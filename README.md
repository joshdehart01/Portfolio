Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree with a focus in Data Analytics from Texas Tech University. Texas Tech has prepared me with a great set of tools and knowledge for my December 2024 graduation. I have a passion for dissecting data, complimented by a curious mind.
