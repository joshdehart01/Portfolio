# Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree with a focus in Data Analytics from Texas Tech University. Texas Tech has prepared me with a great set of tools and knowledge for my December 2024 graduation. During my studies, I have sharpened my ability to spot trends and gain insights from data sets. I have a passion for dissecting data, complimented by a curious mind. Due to my background in Engineering, I bring a unique mindset to projects and discussions. In my free time, I am always looking for new ways to learn and master my skills. I am thrilled to bring my analytical abilities into the field of data!

Within this portfolio, I showcase my skills including Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

Here is a description of each project:
