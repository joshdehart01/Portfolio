# Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree with a focus in Data Analytics from Texas Tech University. This program has prepared me with a great set of tools and knowledge for my December 2024 graduation. During my studies, I have sharpened my ability to spot trends and gain insights from data sets. I have a passion for dissecting data, complimented by a curious mind. Prior to switching to IT, I was an engineering student, which has helped me bring a unique problem solving mindset to projects and discussions. In my free time, I am always looking for new ways to learn and master my skills. I am thrilled to bring my analytical abilities into the field of data!

Within this portfolio, I showcase my skills including Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

Here is a description of each project:


<h2>Movie Success Correlation<h2>
<h4>Goal:</h4>
Determine which factors contribute to a movie's gross profit.
<h4>Description:</h4>
This project is centered around attributes of movies ranging from 1980-2020. The data set includes name, year, genre, votes, director, star, budget, gross profit, company, and other important fields. This project required cleaning of the data, basic statistical operations, and a Pearson correlation analysis.
<h4>Skills Used:</h4>
Data cleaning, Data analysis, Correlation matrix, Data visualization
<h4>Technology:</h4>
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplotlib
<h4>Results:</h4>
After running analysis and the Pearson correlation, we learn that the budget and number of user votes contribute the most to the success of a movie.


<h2>Athlete Web Scrape<h2>
<h4>Goal:</h4>
Scrape site and export data to a CSV for future analysis.
<h4>Description:</h4>
This project revolves around scraping a site that contains information about athletes. There is a parent page that lists an athlete's name, rank, and important metrics. For each athlete, there is a child page you can go to that provides further information including sleep, water consumed, and daily step count. To get the required information for the CSV, this project required a nested loop for each athlete to access the child pages.
<h4>Skills Used:</h4>
Web Scraping, Indexing, Throttling, Exporting data to CSV
<h4>Technology:</h4>
Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests Library, Random Library, CSV Library, Time Library
<h4>Results:</h4>
After accessing the webpage, scraping it, and extracting data, we now have a CSV that is ready for analysis.


<h2>COVID Data Exploration<h2>
<h4>Goal:</h4>
Run basic analysis on COVID data sets to get a variety of different information/statistics.
<h4>Description:</h4>
Using two different data sets containing information about COVID, we run basic calcuations to find results based off of geographical location. The first data set gives information about COVID deaths including country, date (updated daily), new cases, new deaths, and population. The second data set gives information about the COVID vaccines including country, date, new tests, new vaccines, and population. We join these data sets to get information on how the vaccine affected the number of cases and deaths by country/continent.
<h4>Skills Used:</h4>
Joins, CTE, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
<h4>Technology:</h4>
SQL Server
<h4>Results:</h4>
After joining the tables, we learn that new COVID cases slow down after the rollout of the vaccination.
